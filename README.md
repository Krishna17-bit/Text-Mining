- text mining.ipynb - Main script for performing sentiment analysis.
- utils/ - Directory containing utility functions and additional scripts.

## Data Description
The dataset Elon_musk.csv includes the following columns:

Text: The text content of each tweet.
The tweets are preprocessed to remove URLs, emojis, and special characters to ensure clean text input for analysis.

## Library Usage
The project utilizes several libraries:

- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud for data visualization.
- SpaCy and NLTK for natural language processing.
- Scikit-learn for applying machine learning techniques.

## Sentiment Analysis Workflow
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Tweets are loaded and cleaned to remove unnecessary characters and white spaces.
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization are performed.
- Feature Extraction: Features are extracted using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
- Sentiment Classification: Tweets are classified into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.
- Visualization: Results are visualized using word clouds and bar charts to represent sentiment distribution.
